This repository contains code that facilitates the calculation of various parameters related to wing design. The first function involves determining the wing profile area by utilizing specified points outlining the wing profile. The second function is dedicated to computing essential wing parameters, such as aspect ratio, Oswald efficiency number, Smeatonâ€™s coefficient, optimal lift coefficient, induced drag coefficient, drag coefficient, and overall efficiency. The objective is to present a comprehensive array of efficiency values, enabling users to evaluate and select the most suitable efficiency metrics for designing their gliders. Future plans include providing detailed values used in each efficiency calculation, visually representing these values for analysis, and empowering users to tailor their glider parameters for achieving desired efficiency outcomes.
